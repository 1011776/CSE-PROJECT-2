		<h3>About D&D Database</h3>
		D&D database is a tool that I (Alistair Parkinson) have developed.
		It aims to simplify the process of character creation and 
		organisation of characters for the game Dungeons & Dragons at
		my school. I have made all of my code open source, so feel free
		to use what you want in your own projects.

		<h3>How to use D&D Database</h3>
		Since D&D database is still a work in progress, not all 
		features have been fully developed yet.<br>
		For the database to work, the database file, "DND.db", must
		first be created. This can be done by clicking the "Initialise
		Database" button on the homepage. You will be further prompted
		if you want sample data, which will insert sample students, characters,
		spells, etc into the newly generated database file.<br><br>
		Once you have initised the Database file, use the menus on the 
		homepage to view, edit, delete and create characters and information
		surrounding the characters.

		<br><br>

		Further Documentation regarding the Database can be found in the README.md folder.
